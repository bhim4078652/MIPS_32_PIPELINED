# MIPS_32_PIPELINED

## Five stages of MIPS pipelined implementation :
1) Fetch instruction from memory.
2) Read registers while decoding the instruction. The regular format of MIPS instructions allows reading and decoding to occur simultaneously.
3) Execute the operation or calculate an address
4) Access an operand in data memory.
5) Write the result into a register.
